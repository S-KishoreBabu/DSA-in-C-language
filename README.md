<h1>Data Structures in C🎯</h1>

Welcome to my repository of Data Structures implemented in C language!

<h2>About</h2>

This repository contains my implementations of various data structures in C. The goal is to provide simple, easy-to-understand code examples for those learning data structures. However, please note that this code is still a work in progress.

<h2>What to Expect</h2>

<ul>
        <li><b>Code Coverage:</b> Common data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.</li>
        <li><b>C Language:</b> All implementations are in C, aiming for clarity and ease of understanding.</li>
        <li><b>Learning in Progress:</b> I am continuously working to improve and optimize the code. Some functions might be written in a longer form than necessary. There may be mistakes or room for optimization, and I encourage suggestions or contributions!</li>        
</ul>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

If you spot any issues or have suggestions for improving the code, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Any help is appreciated!
